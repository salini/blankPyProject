# blankPyProject

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/salini/blankPyProject.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/salini/blankPyProject)


This project is a blank python project, i.e. it is intended to set in advance all the elements needed to start the development of a new python package.

The setup.py file is used to perform many operation on this package:

* setup.py build_doc: build documentation
* setup.py run_test: run unit tests
* setup.py build_exe [--oneFile]: create stand-alone executable for windows [if --oneFile, zip all in one file]
